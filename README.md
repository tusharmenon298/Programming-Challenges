# **Programming Challenges**
<p> I created this repository for keeping track of all the fun coding problems I have seen on YouTube or any other place and to also find better solutions for it and add more challenges of my own to it</p>
<p> This repository was creating just for me to learn, but feel free to add your own solutions to it </p>
<p> To add on to the challenge, I am trying to stick with the original language used to solve the problem for my own solutions as well </p>

List of Challenges so far....
