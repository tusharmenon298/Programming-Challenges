# *What's the longest word you can write with Seven-Segment Display?*
<br>
This coding challenge was presented by Tom Scott on his Youtube Channel
<br><br>

[Here is the youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp4BMR88260)

<br>
The words.txt file contains 194434 english words in it which is going to be used by all our programs
<br>

## File Descriptions

- The file longestWord.js is the code that he explains in the videos
- The longestWords.js file is the solution to the another challenge that he adds at the end of the video
- The longestWordB.js is another way of solving the problem. In it, the wordList array is first sorted, and then we find the longest acceptable word
- startandend.js finds the biggest letter possible that starts and ends with same character for all alphabets

## What I learned from this challenge?

This challenge helped me understand regex a lot. Also, js has a broken system for regex lol
